![](https://github.com/TAREK199/AIR/blob/master/tp3%204%205/images/1.png?raw=true)

> A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

### The CRUD methods:

* __GET__ to retrieve a resource.
* __PUT__ to change the state of or update a resource
* __POST__ to create that resource
* __DELETE__ to remove it.

> Data formats the REST API supports include:

* Application/json
* Application/xml
* Application/x-wbe+xml
* Application/x-www-form-urlencoded
* Multipart/form-data

> In our case i worked with __Application/json__

> Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is the process of converting Java objects to database tables. In other words, this allows us to interact with a relational database without any SQL. The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification that defines how to persist data in Java applications. The primary focus of JPA is the ORM layer.
Hibernate is one of the most popular Java ORM frameworks in use today. Its first release was almost twenty years ago, and still has excellent community support and regular releases. Additionally, Hibernate is a standard implementation of the JPA specification, with a few additional features that are specific to Hibernate. Let's take a look at some core features of JPA and Hibernate.

### Maven : 
> Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
